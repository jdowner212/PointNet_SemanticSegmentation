# PointNet_SemanticSegmentation
The semantic segmentation portion of the original PointNet repository, converted to compatibility with Tensorflow 2.x and with a 'myCloud' class + utility files for preparing data and visualizing results.

This repository references two others --

https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet

and

2. A modified version with Tensorflow 2.x compatibility.
